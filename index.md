**Aim and Scope**

Optimization is pervasive in scientific and industrial fields, such as artificial intelligence, data mining, bioinformatics, software engineering, scheduling, manufacturing, and economics. The objective functions in practical problems usually exhibit complex functional characteristics, such as multi-modality, large scale, sparsity, constraints, dynamic environment, expensive evaluation, and black box, posing challenges for traditional exact solvers. For example, the evaluation of the objective or constraint functions may involve costly physical experiments or intensive computer simulations, thereby limiting the amount of available data. Moreover, in some cases, the function evaluations can only be calculated on the basis of a large amount of data. Consequently, data-driven optimization has emerged as a powerful solution for these problems to reduce the computational cost and reshape the way we tackle complicated optimization problems, where typically machine learning techniques and optimizers are combined.

Recently, data-driven optimization has attracted increasing attention in learning-based combinatorial optimization. Combinatorial optimization tasks encompass a broad range of domains, including logistics, scheduling, transportation, and manufacturing. Traditional methods based on exact solvers and heuristic-based approaches suffer from huge computational complexity from scratch when tackling large-scale instances. With the development of graph representation learning, neural combinatorial optimization has emerged as a promising paradigm for solving classical combinatorial optimization problems. It empowers neural networks to not only handle the inherent complexity of combinatorial optimization challenges but also to learn powerful information embedded in graph representations. However, existing work on data-driven neural combinatorial optimization still has some limitations such as the dependency on high-quality data, the complexity of training and the restricted transferability among different tasks.

**Organization**

This half-day workshop will consist of two invited speeches (30 minutes each) given by world-leading experts, six regular oral presentations, each having 15 minutes, and a 20-minute free discussion session.  The free discussion session will provide the opportunity for all participants to ask questions and engage in an interactive discussion with the expert, focusing on identifying key challenges, potential collaborations, and future research directions in the field. Finally, the workshop organizers will summarize the key takeaways from the workshop, highlighting important insights, research trends, and potential opportunities that emerged during the discussions.
